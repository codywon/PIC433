Shown are two configurations that I tried and which gave quite good results. 



   Simpler, cheaper but slightly worse is 1/4-wave monopole. Wire length is

1/4 * c/f * vf= 1/4 * 299792458[m/s] / 433.92E6[Hz] * 0.951 = 0.164 [m]

where c is speed of light, f is frequency, vf is velocity factor of copper (shows how much slower than light speed the information travels through it).
Add a ground plane (actually I think it should be at the the base of antenna) with approx. the same dimensions as antenna.

NB! take off the insulation from the wire, it changes the vf!



   More complex but better is half-wave dipole antenna, total length (tip to tip) 2*0.164 = 0.328 m. It needs a balun (the loop of co-ax in the picture is a delay-line type) of half wavelength to align the phase in the antenna (single ended to double ended) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balun
Centre of co-ax goes to antenna hole, shielding to ground pin.

1/2 * c/f * vf = 1/2 * 299792458[m/s] / 433.92E6[Hz] * 0.66 = 0.228 [m]

You can use any 50-ohm co-ax, I used RG 58 c/u, but it is highly attenuating. 
NB! the vf for RG 58 co-ax is 0.66!
NB! Keep co-ax length from module to antenna to minimum, it is highly attenuating!
NB! My RG 58 had shielding which was impossible to solder, so I wrapped a strand of copper around it.
