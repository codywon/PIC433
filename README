Look at the files, try to figure it out. Sending part is easy, receiving times the manchester protocol pulse length and then starts counting time from the transitions.

rxuse.c and txuse.c show an example of application

Makefile shows how to compile using SDCC

command "make all" compiles both the receiving and transmitting parts

Example application circuits shown in transmitter.pdf and receiver.pdf
The used antenna shown in antenna_conf.jpg (quarter-wave monopole antenna wire length 172mm and artificial ground plate approx 180mm x 180mm)

I got at least 30m communication range in city through 5 walls using the cheap 433MHz fs1000a (on 9V battery) and xy-mk-5v pair. Maybe furter also, haven't tested.
